This package is the official portable version of LibreSSL
	(http://www.libressl.org).

LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL 1.0.1 developed by the OpenBSD project.
    (http://www.openbsd.org).

Compatibility with OpenSSL:

 LibreSSL is API compatible with OpenSSL 1.0.1, but does not yet include all
 new APIs from OpenSSL 1.0.2 and later. LibreSSL also includes APIs not yet
 present in OpenSSL. The current common API subset is OpenSSL 1.0.1.

 LibreSSL it is not ABI compatible with any release of OpenSSL, or necessarily
 earlier releases of LibreSSL. You will need to relink your programs to
 LibreSSL in order to use it, just as in moving between major versions of OpenSSL.
 LibreSSL's installed library version numbers are incremented to account for
 ABI and API changes.

Compatibility with other operating systems:

 While primarily developed on and taking advantage of APIs available on OpenBSD,
 the LibreSSL portable project attempts to provide working alternatives for
 other operating systems, and assists with improving OS-native implementations
 where possible.

At the time of this writing, LibreSSL is know to build and work on:

 - Linux (kernel 3.17 or later recommended)
 - FreeBSD (tested with 9.2 and later)
 - NetBSD (tested with 6.1.5)
 - HP-UX (11i)
 - Solaris (11 and later preferred)
 - Mac OS X (tested with 10.8 and later)
 - AIX (5.3 and later)

LibreSSL also supports the following Windows environments:
 - Microsoft Windows (Vista or higher, x86 and x64)
 - Wine (32-bit and 64-bit)
 - Builds with Mingw-w64 and Cygwin

Official release tarballs are available at your friendly neighborhood
OpenBSD mirror in directory LibreSSL, e.g.:

	http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/

although we suggest that you use a mirror:

The LibreSSL portable build framework is also mirrored in Github:

If you have checked this source using Git, follow these initial steps to
prepare the source tree for building:

 1. ensure you have the following packages installed:
	automake, autoconf, bash, git, libtool, perl, pod2man
 2. run './autogen.sh' to prepare the source tree for building
    or run './dist.sh' to prepare a tarball.

Once you have a source tree from Git or FTP, run these commands to build and
install the package on most systems.

  ./configure   # see ./configure --help for configuration options
  make check    # runs builtin unit tests
  make install  # set DESTDIR= to install to an alternate location

OS specific build information:

 - HP-UX (11i)
   Set the UNIX_STD environment variable to '2003' before running 'configure'
   in order to build with the HP C/aC++ compiler. See the "standards(5)" man
   page for more details.

    export UNIX_STD=2003
    ./configure
    make

 - Windows - Mingw-w64
   LibreSSL builds against relatively recent versions of Mingw-w64, not to be
   confused with the original mingw.org project.  Mingw-w64 3.2 or later
   should work. See README.windows for more information
